# Simon Game

## Overview

The Simon Game is a web-based implementation of the classic memory game where players must repeat a sequence of colors and sounds generated by the game. The interface features colored buttons that light up and play tones in a random order, challenging the user to replicate the sequence correctly. This project was built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to create an interactive and nostalgic gaming experience.

## Features

- **Random Sequences**: Generates a progressively longer sequence of colors and sounds for the player to follow.
- **Interactive Buttons**: Colored buttons light up and play sounds when clicked or when part of the sequence.
- **Memory Challenge**: Tests the player's ability to remember and repeat the sequence accurately.

## How to Use

1. Open `index.html` in a web browser.
2. Press the start button (if applicable) to begin the game.
3. Watch and listen to the sequence of colors and sounds.
4. Click the colored buttons in the same order as the sequence.
5. Continue as the sequence grows longer with each successful round.

## Technologies Used

- **HTML**: Provides the structure for the game interface, including the buttons and layout.
- **CSS**: Styles the buttons and game layout for a visually appealing design.
- **JavaScript**: Manages game logic, sequence generation, button interactions, and sound playback.
